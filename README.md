The repository is about creating a simple calculator and changing features of it using python skills and Tkinter. This provides us the basic arithmetic operations with a user-friendly interface. This project is very customizable and can be extended with additional features if desired. 

Main Objective:                                                                               
This project is about creating a simple calculator that will display the pattern of the calculator. That will be codes by which the user can change the features of the calculator including background and foreground colour. The objective of creating this project is to challenge our brains and add some fun while learning python.

Technologies Used:                                                                             
Programming Language: Python                                                                                    
Libraries: Tkinter, Integrated Development Environment(IDE) 

Tkinter is a python library that can be used to construct basic graphical user interface(GUI) applications
   
Steps to be followed for building a code:                                                                                            
The project can be broke down into the following key components:                                                                
Step1: Import everything from the Tkinter using *  .                                                           
Step2: Create an interface for the Calculator.                                                                     
Step3: Create an input function that enters a number into the  input  field.                     
Step4: Create an apparent function that wipes everything from the input field.                                                                                                    
Step5: And finally, evaluate function that computes and gives the result of  the expression.
